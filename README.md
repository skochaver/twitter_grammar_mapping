# twitter_grammar_mapping
Here is a set of hackish scripts I used to make a map of grammar errors in tweets after setting up a Twitter API account. I will post the resulting map if I am happy with it. 

Running the listener_main will go through the vector process flow I have for the project. Taking geotagged tweets and getting the natural language metrics for each in a text file (other file that turned the data into something more GIS usable are not yet included).

The unrealized_raster_dreams file is an unfinished and as-of-yet unrealized version of the project that has much more scientific integrity involved. The intention was to split up the study area into raster cells then set up a listener for each of the cells and have each of the metrics for expansion into full GIS raster files for analysis. Its more "big data"-y intentions mean the free twitter search api wont cut it. Someday I hope to have firehose capabilities or access to a big historical dataset that uses the same search API. It is a pipe dream script...or something.
